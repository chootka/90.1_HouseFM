Exhibited with LittleNets, an exhibition co-curated with Eyebeam's Off-The-Grid exhibition on Governor's Island, NYC, September 6-28, 2014

90.1 House FM is a local area mesh networked soundscape broadcasting over a low FM frequency. 
The network consists of a handful of Raspberry Pis, distributed throughout the house, tucked away in discrete corners. 
Each computer has a unique voice that it broadcasts over local airwaves. 
Walking from room to room, the audible signal from each Raspberry Pi will fade in and out as you move towards and away from each station. 
Put on one of the provided wireless FM headphones and tune into an aural sensory experience on 90.1 House FM.

LittleNets, part of Eyebeam-Off-The-Grid, is a show of alternative networks, offering
different ways of being and making online. Rather than wire Eyebeam’s temporary
Governor’s Island space with internet access, we decided to set up some sitespecific
mesh networks with things that might be useful to have on a remote
island—simple communication tools, artworks, and games. Visitors to the island can
view and contribute content to these networks.

As the free and open web becomes increasingly concentrated and opaque in the
hands of a few companies, the networks of LittleNets suggest that another net (or
a multitude of nets) is still possible.
